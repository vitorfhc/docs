Gecko provides several configuration options to customize how it scans for vulnerabilities and matches patterns. Access these settings by clicking the Gecko extension icon in your browser toolbar.

## Scanners

Control which types of sources Gecko monitors for potential CSPT vulnerabilities.

### Search query values

<ResponseField name="searchQueryValues" type="boolean" default={true}>
When enabled, Gecko extracts values from URL query parameters and monitors if they appear in subsequent HTTP requests.

**Example**: If a URL contains `?file=config.json`, Gecko will check if `config.json` appears in any outgoing requests.
</ResponseField>

### Search path

<ResponseField name="searchPath" type="boolean" default={true}>
When enabled, Gecko extracts values from URL path segments and monitors if they appear in subsequent HTTP requests.

**Example**: If a URL is `/app/users/admin`, Gecko will check if path segments like `users` or `admin` appear in any outgoing requests.
</ResponseField>

### Search null/undefined

<ResponseField name="searchNullUndefined" type="boolean" default={true}>
When enabled, Gecko monitors for JavaScript variables that are null or undefined and checks if they're used in HTTP requests.

This can help identify cases where missing input validation allows null/undefined values to be used in path construction.
</ResponseField>

## Matching rules

Configure how Gecko matches source values in target URLs.

### Partial matching

<ResponseField name="partial" type="boolean" default={true}>
When enabled, Gecko will flag findings even when only part of the source value appears in the target URL.

**Example**: If the source value is `config.json` and the target URL contains `config`, it will be flagged as a potential vulnerability.

Disable this if you're getting too many false positives and only want exact matches.
</ResponseField>

### Partial minimum length

<ResponseField name="partialMinLength" type="number" default={3}>
The minimum length of a partial match to be considered a finding. Only applies when partial matching is enabled.

Increase this value to reduce false positives from very short matches.

**Example**: With a minimum length of 5, a source value of `config.json` would need at least 5 consecutive characters (like `confi` or `config`) to match in the target URL.
</ResponseField>

### Case insensitive

<ResponseField name="caseInsensitive" type="boolean" default={true}>
When enabled, Gecko ignores case differences when matching source values in target URLs.

**Example**: A source value of `Config.json` would match `config.json` in the target URL.

Disable this if you want case-sensitive matching only.
</ResponseField>

## Display options

Control how findings are displayed in the DevTools panel.

### Clear on refresh

<ResponseField name="clearOnRefresh" type="boolean" default={false}>
When enabled, Gecko clears all findings when you refresh the page or navigate to a new URL.

Enable this if you want to start fresh for each page you test. Disable it if you want to accumulate findings across multiple pages.
</ResponseField>

## Recommended configurations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High sensitivity (more findings)" icon="magnifying-glass-plus">
    Use these settings to catch as many potential vulnerabilities as possible:
    
    - **Scanners**: Enable all options
    - **Partial matching**: Enabled
    - **Partial minimum length**: 3
    - **Case insensitive**: Enabled
    - **Clear on refresh**: Disabled
    
    This configuration may produce more false positives but ensures you don't miss any potential vulnerabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low sensitivity (fewer false positives)" icon="magnifying-glass-minus">
    Use these settings to reduce false positives:
    
    - **Scanners**: Enable only query values and path
    - **Partial matching**: Disabled
    - **Case insensitive**: Disabled
    - **Clear on refresh**: Enabled
    
    This configuration will only flag exact matches and may miss some vulnerabilities but produces fewer false positives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Balanced (recommended)" icon="scale-balanced">
    Use these settings for a balance between sensitivity and accuracy:
    
    - **Scanners**: Enable all options
    - **Partial matching**: Enabled
    - **Partial minimum length**: 5
    - **Case insensitive**: Enabled
    - **Clear on refresh**: Disabled
    
    This is the default configuration and works well for most testing scenarios.
  </Accordion>

## Saving settings

All settings are automatically saved to your browser's local storage and persist across browser sessions. Each browser profile maintains its own settings.

The Gecko browser extension includes a devtools panel that displays security findings detected during your browsing session.

## Findings table

The findings table shows all security issues detected by the extension in a compact, easy-to-scan format.

### Viewing findings

The findings table displays:
- **Index**: A sequential number for each finding
- **Value**: The detected security value or pattern
- **Source (S)**: The URL where the finding originated
- **Target (T)**: The destination URL of the finding

To view detailed information about a finding, click on any row in the table. This will open a modal with complete details about the security issue.

### Managing findings

Use the **Clear All** button in the top-right corner of the findings table to remove all current findings from the panel.

<Note>
  The findings table uses a compact design to maximize the number of visible findings while maintaining readability.

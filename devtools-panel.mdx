## Overview

The Gecko DevTools panel provides a compact, streamlined interface for viewing and managing Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) findings discovered during your browsing session.

## Accessing the panel

<Steps>
<Step title="Open DevTools">

Press `F12` or right-click on any page and select **Inspect** to open your browser's DevTools.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Gecko panel">

Click on the **Gecko** tab in the DevTools panel. If you don't see it, click the `>>` icon to reveal additional panels.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Findings table

The findings table displays all detected CSPT vulnerabilities in a compact, easy-to-scan format.

### Table structure

Each row in the findings table shows:

- **Index number**: A unique identifier for each finding (displayed on the left)
- **Source value**: The value that triggered the finding (displayed prominently)
- **Source URL**: The URL where the finding originated (labeled with **S**)
- **Target URL**: The destination URL affected by the finding (labeled with **T**)
- **Chevron icon**: Indicates the row is clickable for more details

### Header

The table header displays:

- **Finding count**: Shows the total number of findings in parentheses (e.g., "Findings (5)")
- **Clear All button**: Removes all findings from the table

### Viewing finding details

To view detailed information about a specific finding:

1. Click anywhere on the finding row in the table
2. A drawer will open on the right side showing complete details including:
   - Full source and target URLs
   - Request and response information
   - Stack traces
   - Additional metadata

<Note>
You must click on the row to open the details drawer. The URLs in the table are not clickable links.
</Note>

## Visual design

The findings table features a modern, compact design:

- **Reduced padding**: Maximizes visible findings without scrolling
- **Small, readable fonts**: 13px for source values, 10px for URLs
- **Subtle colors**: Gray tones for better focus on important information
- **Smooth transitions**: Hover effects provide visual feedback
- **Clear hierarchy**: Source value is emphasized, URLs are secondary

## Managing findings

### Clearing findings

To remove all findings from the table:

1. Click the **Clear All** button in the top-right corner of the table header
2. All findings will be immediately removed

<Warning>
Clearing findings is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure to review any important findings before clearing.
</Warning>

### Real-time updates

The findings table updates automatically as new CSPT vulnerabilities are detected:

- New findings appear at the bottom of the table
- The finding count in the header updates immediately
- The extension icon badge shows the current number of findings

## Tips for effective use

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="eye" title="Scan findings quickly">
    The compact design allows you to scan multiple findings at a glance. Look for patterns in source values or URLs to identify common vulnerability types.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="mouse-pointer" title="Click for details">
    Remember to click on any row to see full details. The table shows cropped URLs for space efficiency, but the drawer displays complete information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="broom" title="Clear regularly">
    Clear findings between testing sessions to avoid confusion. The extension tracks findings per tab, so clearing helps maintain focus on current work.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="bell" title="Monitor the badge">
    Keep an eye on the extension icon badge to see finding counts without opening DevTools. This helps you catch vulnerabilities as they occur.

## Overview

The Gecko browser extension includes a DevTools panel that displays security findings detected during your browsing session. The panel provides a compact, easy-to-navigate interface for reviewing potential security issues.

## Findings table

The findings table displays all security findings detected by the extension in a compact format. Each row in the table shows:

- **Index**: A sequential number for each finding
- **Value**: The detected value that triggered the finding
- **Source (S)**: The URL where the value originated
- **Target (T)**: The URL where the value was detected

### Viewing finding details

To view detailed information about a finding:

1. Click anywhere on the row in the findings table
2. A modal will open displaying complete details about the finding, including:
   - Full source and target URLs
   - Complete value information
   - Additional context about the security issue

<Tip>
  Click directly on any finding row to quickly access its full details.
</Tip>

### Managing findings

The findings table includes a **Clear All** button in the top-right corner that allows you to remove all findings from the current session. This is useful when you want to start fresh or after you've reviewed and addressed the detected issues.

<Note>
  The findings counter in the header shows the total number of findings currently displayed in the table.

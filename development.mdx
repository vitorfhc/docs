Once you have Gecko installed, you can start using it to discover potential CSPT vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Opening the DevTools panel

<Steps>
<Step title="Open DevTools">

Open Chrome DevTools by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting **Inspect**.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to the Gecko panel">

In the DevTools toolbar, you'll see a **Gecko** tab. Click on it to open the Gecko panel.

<Tip>If you don't see the Gecko tab, try closing and reopening DevTools.</Tip>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing findings

As you browse a web application, Gecko automatically monitors HTTP requests and analyzes them for potential CSPT vulnerabilities.

### Understanding the findings table

The Gecko panel displays a table with all detected findings. Each row represents a potential vulnerability with the following information:

- **Source**: Where the potentially malicious input originated (query parameter, path, or variable)
- **Source URL**: The URL containing the source value
- **Target URL**: The HTTP request that included the source value
- **Type**: The type of source (e.g., "Query Parameter", "Path", "Null Variable")

### Viewing finding details

Click on any finding in the table to open a detailed drawer with more information:

- Full source and target URLs
- The exact value that was matched
- Source type classification

### Real-time badge

The Gecko extension icon displays a badge showing the number of current findings. This allows you to monitor vulnerabilities without opening DevTools.

## Searching and filtering

Use the search bar at the top of the Gecko panel to filter findings by:

- Source URL
- Target URL
- Source value

This helps you focus on specific types of vulnerabilities or particular parts of the application.

## Configuring settings

Click the Gecko extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings popup. Here you can customize:

- **Scanners**: Which types of sources to monitor
- **Matching rules**: How strictly to match source values in target URLs
- **Display options**: Whether to clear findings on page refresh

See the [Configuration](/configuration) page for detailed information about each setting.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test in a safe environment" icon="shield">
    Always use Gecko in a testing or development environment, not on production systems you don't own or have permission to test.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify findings manually" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Gecko identifies potential vulnerabilities, but you should manually verify each finding to confirm it's a real security issue and not a false positive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear findings between tests" icon="broom">
    Enable "Clear on refresh" in settings to start fresh when testing different pages or applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adjust sensitivity" icon="sliders">
    If you're getting too many false positives, increase the minimum partial match length or disable partial matching in the settings.
  </Accordion>

## Privacy and security

Gecko operates entirely locally in your browser. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers. All analysis happens on your machine.

## Setting up your development environment

Follow these steps to set up Gecko for local development.

<Steps>
<Step title="Fork and clone the repository">

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gecko.git
cd gecko
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">

```bash
npm install
```

</Step>

<Step title="Build the extension">

Build for your target browser:

```bash
# Chrome
npm run build:chrome

# Firefox
npm run build:ff
```

The build process creates a `dist` folder with all necessary extension files.

</Step>

<Step title="Load the extension in your browser">

**For Chrome:**

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `dist` folder

**For Firefox:**

1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**
3. Select any file in the `dist` folder

</Step>

## Key components

### Findings table

The findings table component (`src/components/findings-table.tsx`) displays discovered CSPT vulnerabilities with a compact, modern interface:

- **Header**: Shows finding count in format "Findings (N)" and "Clear All" button
- **Table rows**: Display finding index, source value, source URL (S), and target URL (T)
- **Hover effects**: Smooth transitions on row hover with `transition-colors` class
- **Click handling**: Entire row is clickable and opens detailed view in drawer

<Note>
Users must click on the row to view details. The URLs in the table are not clickable links - they're displayed for quick reference only.
</Note>

### Recent improvements (PR #7)

The findings table was recently improved with:

- **Compact design**: Reduced padding (`py-2` instead of `py-4`) and smaller fonts (13px for values, 10px for URLs)
- **Finding count**: Displayed in header as "Findings (N)" with uppercase styling
- **Inline URLs**: Source and target URLs shown on same line with "S" and "T" labels
- **Better hierarchy**: Source value emphasized with `font-medium`, URLs in lighter gray
- **Smoother transitions**: Added `transition-colors` class for hover effects
- **Smaller button**: "Clear All" button uses 10px font with uppercase tracking

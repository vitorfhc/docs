# Gecko 🦎

Gecko is a powerful cross-browser extension designed to automate the discovery of Client-Side Path Traversals (CSPT) in web applications. It seamlessly integrates with DevTools and provides a user-friendly interface for identifying and analyzing CSPT vulnerabilities.

## What is Client-Side Path Traversal?

Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) is a security vulnerability where user-controlled input from the URL (query parameters, path segments) is used to construct paths for fetching resources without proper validation. This can allow attackers to access unintended files or resources.

## How it works

Gecko monitors HTTP requests made by your browser and analyzes them for potential CSPT vulnerabilities by:

1. **Scanning sources**: Extracting values from query parameters, URL paths, and JavaScript variables
2. **Tracking targets**: Monitoring outgoing HTTP requests
3. **Matching patterns**: Identifying when source values appear in target URLs
4. **Reporting findings**: Displaying potential vulnerabilities in the DevTools panel

All analysis happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to external servers.

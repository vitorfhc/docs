Gecko identifies potential Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) vulnerabilities by monitoring how user-controlled input flows into HTTP requests. Understanding what each finding means is crucial for effective security testing.

## Anatomy of a finding

Each finding in Gecko consists of two main components:

### Source

The **source** is where the potentially malicious input originates. Gecko monitors several types of sources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Query parameter" icon="question">
    Values extracted from URL query parameters.
    
    **Example**: In `https://example.com/app?file=config.json`, the value `config.json` is extracted from the `file` parameter.
    
    **Risk**: Attackers can easily manipulate query parameters to inject malicious paths.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Query parameter (URL encoded)" icon="code">
    Values from query parameters that are URL encoded.
    
    **Example**: In `https://example.com/app?path=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`, the encoded value `%2Fetc%2Fpasswd` (which decodes to `/etc/passwd`) is tracked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Query parameter (URL decoded)" icon="unlock">
    The decoded version of URL-encoded query parameter values.
    
    **Example**: The decoded value `/etc/passwd` from `%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Path" icon="route">
    Values extracted from URL path segments.
    
    **Example**: In `https://example.com/files/documents/report.pdf`, segments like `documents` and `report.pdf` are tracked.
    
    **Risk**: Path segments can sometimes be manipulated through routing or URL rewriting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Path (URL encoded/decoded)" icon="route">
    Similar to query parameters, path values can also be tracked in their encoded and decoded forms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Null variable" icon="ban">
    JavaScript variables that are null or undefined.
    
    **Risk**: If an application doesn't properly validate variables before using them in paths, null/undefined values might allow path traversal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Target

The **target** is an HTTP request that contains the source value. This indicates that user-controlled input is being used to construct a request URL, which could be a vulnerability.

**Example**: If the source is `config.json` from a query parameter, and Gecko detects an HTTP request to `https://api.example.com/files/config.json`, this would be flagged as a finding.

## Types of matches

Gecko can identify findings using different matching strategies:

### Exact match

The entire source value appears in the target URL.

**Example**:
- Source: `admin/config.json`
- Target: `https://api.example.com/files/admin/config.json`
- Match: Exact

### Partial match

Only part of the source value appears in the target URL.

**Example**:
- Source: `admin/config.json`
- Target: `https://api.example.com/files/config.json`
- Match: Partial (`config.json`)

Partial matches can be configured in the [settings](/configuration) to require a minimum length.

### Case-insensitive match

The source value matches the target URL when ignoring case differences.

**Example**:
- Source: `Config.JSON`
- Target: `https://api.example.com/files/config.json`
- Match: Case-insensitive

## Validating findings

Not all findings are actual vulnerabilities. Follow these steps to validate each finding:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review the finding">

Examine the source and target URLs to understand the data flow:
- Where did the source value come from?
- How is it being used in the target request?
- Is there any transformation or validation happening?

</Step>

<Step title="Test for path traversal">

Try to exploit the potential vulnerability by manipulating the source:

1. Modify the query parameter or path to include path traversal sequences like `../`
2. Try to access sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` (on Linux) or `C:\Windows\System32\config\sam` (on Windows)
3. Observe if the application allows access to unintended resources

**Example**: If the finding shows `?file=config.json`, try `?file=../../../etc/passwd`

</Step>

<Step title="Check for validation">

Determine if the application has proper input validation:
- Does it sanitize path traversal sequences?
- Does it restrict access to a specific directory?
- Does it validate file extensions or paths?

</Step>

<Step title="Assess impact">

If the vulnerability is confirmed, evaluate its severity:
- What files or resources can be accessed?
- Is authentication required?
- What is the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability?

</Step>
</Steps>

## Common false positives

Gecko may flag findings that aren't actual vulnerabilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legitimate file access" icon="check">
    The application may legitimately use user input to access files within a restricted directory.
    
    **Example**: A document viewer that loads files from a user's personal folder.
    
    **Validation**: Check if the application properly restricts access to only authorized files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Coincidental matches" icon="shuffle">
    The source value may coincidentally appear in the target URL without any actual relationship.
    
    **Example**: A query parameter `id=123` matching a request to `/api/users/123` where `123` is a user ID, not derived from the query parameter.
    
    **Validation**: Verify if the source value actually influences the target request.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Short partial matches" icon="text-size">
    Very short partial matches may be coincidental.
    
    **Example**: A source value of `file` matching any URL containing the word "file".
    
    **Solution**: Increase the minimum partial match length in [settings](/configuration).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test systematically" icon="list-check">
    Work through findings methodically, starting with the most suspicious ones.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document your findings" icon="file-pen">
    Keep notes on which findings are real vulnerabilities and which are false positives.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adjust settings" icon="sliders">
    Fine-tune Gecko's configuration to reduce false positives for your specific testing scenario.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verify manually" icon="hand-pointer">
    Always manually verify potential vulnerabilities before reporting them.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a real CSPT vulnerability:

1. **Document the vulnerability**: Include the source URL, target URL, steps to reproduce, and potential impact
2. **Follow responsible disclosure**: Report the vulnerability to the application owner through their security contact or bug bounty program
3. **Don't exploit in production**: Only test in authorized environments with permission
4. **Provide remediation guidance**: Suggest how to fix the vulnerability (e.g., input validation, path sanitization)
